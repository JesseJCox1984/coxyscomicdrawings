                    <h2>Jesse Cox</h2>
                    <p>As a current student at East Central University (ECU), pursuing a Bachelor of Design degree, my journey through the world of art and creativity has been nothing short of exhilarating. From a young age, I've been captivated by the power of visual storytelling, drawn to the vibrant pages of comic books that ignited my imagination and fueled my passion for drawing. Growing up, I immersed myself in the colorful worlds of various comic book genres, from classic superhero tales to gritty graphic novels. These diverse narratives inspired me to explore different artistic styles and techniques, laying the foundation for my love of both traditional comic art and cutting-edge 3D imagery. As I embarked on my academic journey at ECU, I discovered a newfound appreciation for the rich history and culture of feudal Japan. Delving into the fascinating world of samurai warriors and feudal lords, I found myself drawn to the intricate folk tales and legendary exploits that shaped this iconic era. From the heroic deeds of famous samurais to the mysterious allure of ancient Japanese folklore, each story served as a source of inspiration for my artistic endeavors. Today, as I continue to hone my skills in design and illustration, I find myself channeling my passion for comics and 3D imagery into creating captivating visual narratives that pay homage to my childhood heroes and the timeless tales of feudal Japan. With each stroke of the pen and click of the mouse, I strive to bring to life the dynamic characters and immersive worlds that have fueled my imagination for as long as I can remember.</p>
